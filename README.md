# weather_monitor
A weather system that receives data from the ESP8266 and BME280, makes a weather forecast based on the data, and displays it on the website.
To get started, create port 5000 on your router. Then install all the necessary dependencies and simply run the server.py file. Now, add your server's IP address to the esp8266 firmware file and flash it with the completed platformio project. The data should appear on your website!
